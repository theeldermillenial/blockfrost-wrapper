## Why do I need this package?

If you use Blockfrost to pull in a lot of data, boilerplate code will be needed to make
sure the rate limit is respected. `blockfrost-wrapper` is simply a wrapper around the
official `blockfrost-python` code that does a few things:
1. Improves security by initializing `BlockFrostAPI` from an environment file rather
than storing credentials in code.
2. Monitors call frequency stalls API calls when nearing the rate limit.
3. Throws an error when nearing a predefined call limit.

In addition to this, pydantic classes for responses have been autogenerated to
both validate and provide give good type hints for the BlockFrost API responses, since
the `blockfrost-api` has no type hints due to the way they handle responses. In the
future, each API call will be wrapped with the appropriate pydantic class for a better
development experience.

## How do I use it?

Just like you would use the `blockfrost-python` package! Just initialize the Blockfrost
API class using `blockfrost_limiter`, then use just like you would `blockfrost-python`.

To make configuration easier and help prevent sharing a project ID in your code, the use
of an environment file is also enabled. Check out the examples below.
